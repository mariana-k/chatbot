# Introduction - What is AWS Lex


> "Amazon Lex is a service for building conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text."

 and natural language understanding (NLU) to recognize the intent of the text, toenable you to build applications with highly engaging
  user experiences and lifelike conversational interactions. With Amazon Lex, the same deep learning technologies that power Amazon Alexa
  are now available to any developer,enabling you to quickly and easily build sophisticated, natural language,
  conversational bots (“chatbots”).-->

# Difficulties we faced

- easy to get a bot up and running - harder to integrate it (cors, roles, coudformation, cognito, etc.)
- styling of the bot-ui

# Restrictions
- English only for now
- unable to call services on mesos(dev)
- no complex flows?
?
